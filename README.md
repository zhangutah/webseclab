# Web Security Lab

## Credits
The tasks posted in this repo are borrowed from the SEED Labs: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labs.html. The credits go to Prof. Wenliang Du and his group at Syracuse.

## Setup 

(For VMWare user, please refer to "VMWareSetup.md" )

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads);
2. Download a pre-built SEED VM from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/138fqx0F8bThLm9ka8cnuxmrD6irtz_4m/view?usp=sharing) or [Direct Download Link](https://seed.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/SEED-Ubuntu20.04.zip)
3. Create a new VM from the pre-built VM disk.

### The VM's USERNAME: seed, PASSWORD: dees

### Create a lab VM

* Open the VirtualBox, click "New"

![1](./images/1.png)

* Create a Virtual Machine as the picture shows

![2](./images/2.png)

* Choose the "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" , and the hard disk file is the pre-built VM disk file downloaded above. 

![3](./images/3.png)

* Start the Virtual Machine

### Frequently asked questions

**I finished the first experiment and want to do the second one, but there are problems with the service startup**

When you complete your first experiment (such as XSS or CSRF), please stop the former docker containers by executing `docker-compose down ` under the "Labsetup" path. ( or just reboot the VM )  Then follow the "Set up the Web Security environment" instructions. 
![](images/9.png)

It is recommended to complete different experiments under different paths. eg. download "Labsetup.zip" for XSS to `~/Downloads/XSS/` , and download "Labsetup.zip" for CSRF to `~/Downloads/CSRF/`

**When visiting some hosts (`www.attacker32.com`, `www.seed-server.com`), the browser took me to GoDaddy**

Please check the `/etc/hosts` file inside the VM, and make sure IP and hosts correct. It should be noted that these names might have already been added to the file due to some other
labs. If they are mapped to different IP addresses, the old entries must be removed. You can also manually edit this file with `sudo`, and the sample looks like the following:

```
10.9.0.5 www.seed-server.com
10.9.0.5 www.example32.com
10.9.0.105 www.attacker32.com
```

And try use "New Private Window", because the cache will be cleared after closing the browser.

### Set up the Web Security environment (XSS)

Inside the Lab VM:

1. Open a Terminal
2. Download the required file: `wget --no-check-certificate -c https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Web_XSS_Elgg/Labsetup.zip`
3. Run `unzip Labsetup.zip && cd Labsetup`
4. Edit the hosts file, and add a line at the end of the `/etc/hosts` file, eg: `echo 10.9.0.5        www.seed-server.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts `
5. Run `docker-compose up -d`
6. Open a browser, and visit `www.seed-server.com`
7. Username:`alice`, Password: `seedalice`; or Username: `boby`, Password: `seedboby`

（Run `docker-compose down` to shut down the server, if you finished this section. ）

### Set up the Web Security environment (CSRF)

Inside the Lab VM:

1. Open a Terminal
2. Download the required file: `wget --no-check-certificate -c https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Web_CSRF_Elgg/Labsetup.zip`
3. Run `unzip Labsetup.zip && cd Labsetup`
4. Edit the hosts file, and add a line at the end of the `/etc/hosts` file, eg: `echo 10.9.0.5        www.seed-server.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts `; `echo 10.9.0.5 www.example32.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`; `echo 10.9.0.105 www.attacker32.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`
5. Run `docker-compose up -d`
6. Open a browser, and visit `www.seed-server.com`
7. Username:`alice`, Password: `seedalice`; or Username: `samy`, Password: `seedsamy`
8. Edit the attacker's pages: run `dockps` to check the container "attacker"'s id, and use `docksh <container id>` to edit attacker's html inside a container. eg:

```bash
[02/13/22]seed@VM:~/.../Labsetup$ dockps
53856dffc574  attacker-10.9.0.105
ca925c10bf2c  elgg-10.9.0.5
50ea207fc673  mysql-10.9.0.6
[02/13/22]seed@VM:~/.../Labsetup$ docksh 53856dffc574
root@53856dffc574:/# cd /var/www/attacker/
root@53856dffc574:/var/www/attacker# nano addfriend.html
```

### Set up the Web Security environment (SQLi)

Inside the Lab VM:

1. Open a Terminal
2. Download the required file: `wget --no-check-certificate -c https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Web_SQL_Injection/Labsetup.zip`
3. Run `unzip Labsetup.zip && cd Labsetup`
4. Edit the hosts file, and add a line at the end of the `/etc/hosts` file, eg: `echo 10.9.0.5        www.seed-server.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts `
5. Run `docker-compose up -d`
6. Open a browser, and visit `www.seed-server.com`
7. Username:`alice`, Password: `seedalice`; or Username: `admin`, Password: `seedadmin`


## Discover XSS vulnerabilities

### Task 1: Display an Alert Window when visiting a user's profile

You can edit Boby's profile from this link: `http://www.seed-server.com/profile/boby/edit`

Make some changes, so that an Alert Window will be prompted:

![4](./images/4.png)

### Task 2: Stealing Cookies from the Victim’s Machine

Boby commented on a post of Alice, when Alice views the comment, Alice's cookie will be stolen. 

You may need to write some Javascript code to send the victim's cookie to your server



## Discover CSRF vulnerabilities

### Task 1: CSRF Attack using GET Request

Alice and Samy. Samy wants to become a friend to Alice, but Alice refuses to add him to her Elgg friend list. Samy decides to use the CSRF attack to
achieve his goal. He sends Alice an URL (via an email or a posting in Elgg); Alice, curious about it, clicks on the URL, which leads her to Samy’s web site: `www.attacker32.com`. Pretend that you are Samy, describe how you can construct the content of the web page, so as soon as Alice visits the web page, Samy is added to the friend list of Alice (assuming Alice has an active session with Elgg).

You need to edit the `addfriend.html` insider the `attacker-10.9.0.105` container, and the page can be accessed from `http://www.attacker32.com/addfriend.html`

### Task 2: CSRF Attack using POST Request

Samy plans to use a CSRF attack to modify Alice's profile.


## Discover SQLi vulnerabilities

### Task 1: SQL Injection Attack on SELECT Statement

The PHP code unsafe home.php is located in the `/var/www/SQL_Injection directory`.

```bash
[02/13/22]seed@VM:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                 NAMES

root@3abc9ed9486b:/var/www# cd /var/www/SQL_Injection/
root@3abc9ed9486b:/var/www# nano unsafe_home.php
```

Use the login page from www.seed-server.com , User DB:
```
Name    Employee ID         Password    Salary Birthday SSN Nickname Email Address Phone#
Admin   99999               seedadmin   400000 3/5      43254314
Alice   10000               seedalice   20000 9/20      10211002
Boby    20000               seedboby    50000 4/20      10213352

```

You need to execute a new SQL statement using the SQL injection vulnerability.

HINT: You can simply use curl to verify SQL Injection vulnerabilities, eg. `curl 'www.seed-server.com/unsafe_home.php?username=alice%27&Password=11'`. You will find that the server says there is an SQL statement error:

![10](images/10.png)

The PHP code `unsafe_home.php`, located in the `/var/www/SQL_Injection directory` inside the www docker container, is used to conduct user authentication. Think about why this problem occurs by locating the relevant php code.

![11](images/11.png)

You also need to think about this question, why did I enter my username as `admin'#` and the server directly let me log in, no matter what password I input ?

`http://www.seed-server.com/unsafe_home.php?username=admin%27%23&Password=anypass`

### Task 2: SQL Injection Attack on UPDATE Statement

The PHP code was implemented in `unsafe_edit_backend.php` file.

Use SQL injection vulnerability to modify any user's information.
